# What is binutils? #
binutils is a Python module written in C++ and Python which provides various memory hacking operations:
  * Dynamic function calls
  * Dynamic function pre/post-hooks
  * Dynamic callback creation (create C++ functions in Python)
  * Reading/writing memory addresses
  * Various search mechanisms to find addresses in memory
  * A really flexible interface to reconstruct and construct non-native C/C++ types

It utilizes Boost.Python to provide an easy and clean interface. Take a look at the [Wiki](http://code.google.com/p/binutils/w/list) for examples.
